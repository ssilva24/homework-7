CISC 3300 Homework 7: PHP Intro

2. What are some examples of how PHP and JavaScript are alike and how they differ?
    PHP: HyperText Processor, an interpreted programming language used to build webpages
        it is an interpreted JavaScript
        it is alike to JavaScript because they both are interpreted line by line
        both PHP and JavaScript also have the same arithmetic operators,
        both also have type guessing for variables

        it differs from JavaScript because PHP is a bit stricter with semicolons at the end of statements
        the PHP string concat is different than Js, the period symbol concats two strings : .=
        a difference is that in PHP, function scope ois closed off and we dont pass any variables from parent scope
        some other differences are that PHP doesnt execute within the browser but JS does
        PHP supports databse while JS doesnt

3. Define MVC, what are the responsibilities of each piece?
    MVC is an architectural/design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components:
        Model
        View 
        Controller 
    Each architectural component is built to handle specific development aspects of an application
    It isolates the business logic and presentation layer from each other

    Controller
        enables the interconnection between the views and model so it acts as an intermediator
        doesnt worry about handling data logic, only tells model what to do 
        processes all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulates data using Model component and interacts with view to render final output

    View    
        used for all the UI logic of the application
        generates a user interface for the user
        created by the data which is collected by the model component but these data arent tasken directly but through the controller 
        only interacts with the controller
     Model  
        corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with
        represents either data that is being transferred between the view and controller components, or any other business logic data
        adds or retrieves data from database, responds to controller's request, interacts with database and gives required data back to controller
