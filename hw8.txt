1. What does it mean to escape data? How does escaping data help us avoid malicious
code?
    - Escaping data is meant to make sure that nothing is malicious
    - it preserves data as it enters another context. it secures output data by stripping out unwanted data
    - the first step to escape input is to escape output, to not allow hackers to send us malicious code 
    - escaping data involves removing and replacing any characters that should not appear in a value
    - an example of the risks of not escaping data are xss attacks
2. Please read through: https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-rest
    a. What is REST? What is meant by Statelessness?
        REST, which stands for Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style that provides a standard
        between computer systems on the web which makes it easier for the systems to communicate.

        Statelessness means that the server does not need to know anything about the state that the client is in, and viceversa.
        That way both the server and the client underatand any message that is recieved without seeing the previous messages
    b. What is a resource?
        A resource is the nouns of the web, because they describe any object and document or anything that can be needed to store or 
        send to other services 
    c. Look at the section on Path design: In a RESTful architecture paradigm what
    would be the proper way to create a path for: (provide URL and HTTP method):
        i. getting a list of users?
            url: '/users'
            http method: GET
        ii. getting a particular user?
            url: '/users/{userId}'
            HTTP method: GET
        iii. saving a user?
            url: '/users'
            http method: POST

3. What is a Cookie?
    -they are small text files used to store user information on the user's device
    -they ask permission to save a bit of data on their browser to keep track of you
    -with that cookie, it is allowed to make more requests. it is a way the server knows that it is you
    and that the browser session has been authenticated
    - these cookies expire after a specificed time
4. What is a Session?
    -they are used to store the user information on the user's server side
    -this ends when the user closes the browser
    -your session doing something on the page
    -they are on the back end, and store information about a user and their preferences
